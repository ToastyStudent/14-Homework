# 14-Homework-Tech-Blog-Challenge

## Description
This project was built from code provided via Northwestern University's Full-stack Development Coding Bootcamp's TAs, with me rewriting code in order to ensure I understand how to properly build the app were I to attempt to do so again under less time constraints than those I am currently under.

Specifically, I used using Handlebars.js, Sequelize, and the express-session npm package for authentication in a CMS-style blog in which a logged in user can create posts and comments.

# Installation and Usage
No installation is required. One only needs to visit the deployed Heroku page for this project in order to interact/use it properly. 

Said interaction/usage would involve simply creating an account via signing up and then creating posts and/or comments on other posts, all of which can be deleted.
